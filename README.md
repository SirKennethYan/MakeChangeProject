# Lessons Learned

I learned that each day I hopped onto Eclipse, I became slightly more confident than the day before. I tried at least a dozen differnt things that all failed. I even rewrote the entire code because my orginal code became so FUBAR that I felt I had no choice but to start over. The second time I went through it, I felt like my mind had a better game plan and much more logical approach. My first week I felt I struggled writing basic fundmentals like for-loops, methods, etc; but when it came down to it, I was able to remember how to write all the syntax.
